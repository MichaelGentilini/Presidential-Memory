# Clicky Game

_A memory game built with React and requires the concepts of components, state, and basic event handling._

The application is started using <code>npm start</code>

1. On start, 12 presidential images are rendered to the screen.

2. When the user clicks on a president the score increases by one with the top score also tracked.

3. Every time a president is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. If the user clicks the same president again the count resets to 0.
